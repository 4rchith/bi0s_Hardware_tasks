The tasks that I have completed.

## SANITY_CHECK
sanity check is basically filling a google form.
I learned how to fill a google form.

## SANITY_CHECK-2
sanity check-2 also helped me do google forms

## IRC
IRC,s motive was to log into a specific group in libera chat
IRC orInternet relay chat is basically for short messages

## Wifi_Hacking-1
   I accessed the handshake file using wireshark to open up the package by searching for its authentication protocol over the lan.
   I found the protocol(from the protocols wireshark has captured) in which the identities are shared.
   After opening up the handshake we identify the wpa key data which was exchanged between the two adapters,we need to crack it in order to get the          password.
   These commands were used on kali accessing the wordlist in rockyou.txt to bruteforce the password:
      Command aircrack -ng <handshake_filename> -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
      The result of the brute force will give u the password that we seek for the secret wifi.
    
## Chan's favorite
   We were given an audio file which was basically playing a frequency continuosly,
   we tried to use audacity as hinted and found an option known as spectrogram which gave an image.
   
 ## ~logic
   Logic was basically about a logic gate circuit with 4 inputs.
   I solved the logic gate using someones equations that we learnt in 12th.
   Then trial and errored the four values.
  
 ## find_thyself
   It was a powersocket with a name on it.
   I lensed it using google and found out that it was a company which was region specific.
   So found where thy self was kidnapped to.
 
## grep_it
   By  using grep in ubuntu I wasted lot of time.
   Then used man grep it to find an option which gives back only the text file similar to the ascii text format which we input
   The option was -a or --text which is similar to --binary-files=text option.
