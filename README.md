        I learned how to fill a google form.
        That I am sane up to a point.

## IRC
IRC,s motive was to log into a specific group in libera chat
IRC or Internet relay chat is basically for short messages.

Learned: What an IRC is.
         Seniors are cool.

## Wifi_Hacking-1
   I accessed the handshake file using wireshark to open up the package by searching for its authentication protocol over the lan.
   I found the protocol(from the protocols wireshark has captured) in which the identities are shared.
   After opening up the handshake we identify the wpa key data which was exchanged between the two adapters,we need to crack it in order to get the            password.
   These commands were used on kali accessing the wordlist in rockyou.txt to bruteforce the password:
      Command aircrack -ng <handshake_filename> -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt
      The result of the brute force will give u the password that we seek for the secret wifi.
      
   Learned: 
          How to deauth.
          I got to know what a protocol means.
          aircrack -ng uses.
          iwconfig.
          wireshark overview.
          
    
## Chan's favorite
   We were given an audio file which was basically playing a frequency continuosly,
   we tried to use audacity as hinted and found an option known as spectrogram which gave an image.
   
   Learned:
          How to analyse something, and patience.
   
 ## ~logic
   Logic was basically about a logic gate circuit with four inputs.
   I solved the logic gate using someones equations that we learnt in 12th.
   Then trial and errored the four values.
   
   Learned: 
          Long lost logic gate solving skills were recovered.
  
 ## find_thyself
   It was a powersocket with a name on it.
   I lensed it using google and found out that it was a company which was region specific.
   So found where thy self was kidnapped to.
   
   Learned:
           Googling skills basics completed.
 
## grep_it
   By  using grep in ubuntu I wasted lot of time.
   Then used man grep it to find an option which gives back only the text file similar to the ascii text format which we input
   The option was -a or --text which is similar to --binary-files=text option.
   
   Learned:
          How to find the text that we want in a file using grep.
          Basic grep options preview.
   
## DOZ3N_IS_K3Y
   I used grep with flag on the string and got an encrypted file, which we decrypted to get the flag.
   
   Learned:  
            To use grep command in linux.
            To decrypt caeser text.
   
## xoring
   In it I used the python base code which was given and altered it to give the xored output.
   
   Learned:
         What xoring is.
         How xoring encryption works.
              
## Lifetimesettlement
   I identified the cipher as spoon cipher using a cipher identifier.
   Decrypted it using spoon dcode.
   
   Learned:
           Basic working of spoon cipher.
   
## Caesercipher
  I identified the cipher to be caeser cipher using a cipher identifier.
  Decrypted it using ceaser decoder.
 
 Learned: 
         How caeser cipher operates.
 
## da_french_cipher

  I identified the cipher, vigenere cipher .
  Decrypted the encrypted text using vigenere decoder.
  
  Learned:
          Vigenere cipher basics.
