## SANITY_CHECK
Sanity check is basically filling a google form.

Learned: 
        I learned how to fill a google form.<br />
        That I am sane up to a point.<br />

## SANITY_CHECK-1
 Joined the discord
 
 Learned: 
         To get back my long lost discord acc after hours of authentication barriers.<br />
         Also that Im sane(Just double checking if Im actually sane).<br />
 

## SANITY_CHECK-2
Sanity check-2 also helped me do google forms

Learned : <br /> 
         That I am sane up to a point(Sanity check last one completed).<br />

## IRC
IRC,s motive was to log into a specific group in libera chat.<br />
IRC or Internet relay chat is basically for short messages.<br />

Learned: <br />
         What an IRC is.<br />
         Seniors are cool.

## Wifi_Hacking-1
   I accessed the handshake file using wireshark to open up the package by searching for its authentication protocol over the lan.<br />
   I found the protocol(from the protocols wireshark has captured) in which the identities are shared.<br />
   After opening up the handshake we identify the wpa key data which was exchanged between the two adapters,we need to crack it in order to get the            password.<br />
   These commands were used on kali accessing the wordlist in rockyou.txt to bruteforce the password:<br />
      Command aircrack -ng <handshake_filename> -w /usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt<br />
      The result of the brute force will give u the password that we seek for the secret wifi.<br />
      
   Learned: <br />
          How to deauth.<br />
          I got to know what a protocol means.<br />
          aircrack -ng uses.<br />
          iwconfig.<br />
          wireshark overview.<br />
          
    
## Chan's favorite
   We were given an audio file which was basically playing a frequency continuosly,<br />
   we tried to use audacity as hinted and found an option known as spectrogram which gave an image.<br />
   
   Learned:<br />
          How to analyse something, and patience.<br />
   
 ## ~logic
   Logic was basically about a logic gate circuit with four inputs.<br />
   I solved the logic gate using someones equations that we learnt in 12th.<br />
   Then trial and errored the four values.<br />
   
   Learned: <br />
          Long lost logic gate solving skills were recovered.<br />
  
 ## find_thyself
   It was a powersocket with a name on it.<br />
   I lensed it using google and found out that it was a company which was region specific.<br />
   So found where thy self was kidnapped to.<br />
   
   Learned:<br />
           Googling skills basics completed.<br />
 
## grep_it
   By  using grep in ubuntu I wasted lot of time.<br />
   Then used man grep it to find an option which gives back only the text file similar to the ascii text format which we input<br />
   The option was -a or --text which is similar to --binary-files=text option.<br />
   
   Learned:<br />
          How to find the text that we want in a file using grep.<br />
          Basic grep options preview.<br />
   
## DOZ3N_IS_K3Y
   I used grep with flag on the string and got an encrypted file, which we decrypted to get the flag.
   
   Learned:<br />
            To use grep command in linux.<br />
            To decrypt caeser text.<br />
   
## xoring
   In it I used the python base code which was given and altered it to give the xored output.
   
   Learned:<br />
         What xoring is.<br />
         How xoring encryption works.
              
## Lifetimesettlement
   I identified the cipher as spoon cipher using a cipher identifier.
   Decrypted it using spoon dcode.
   
   Learned:<br />
           Basic working of spoon cipher.
   
## Caesercipher
  I identified the cipher to be caeser cipher using a cipher identifier.<br />
  Decrypted it using ceaser decoder.
 
 Learned: <br />
         How caeser cipher operates.
 
## da_french_cipher

  I identified the cipher, vigenere cipher .<br />
  Decrypted the encrypted text using vigenere decoder.
  
  Learned:<br />
          Vigenere cipher basics.
